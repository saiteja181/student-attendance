React Student Attendance System
This is a student attendance system built with React that allows users to input the roll number, name, checkin time, and checkout time of a student, and keep a record of students present in the school. The system uses the useState() and useEffect() hooks to manage the state of the app, and does not use any external dependencies.

Features
Add students to the attendance list with their roll number, name, checkin time, and checkout time.
Remove students from the attendance list.
View the number of students present in the school.
Responsive design using TailwindCSS.
